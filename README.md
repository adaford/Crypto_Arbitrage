# CoinMarketCap.com compare --------------- This one works much better

$python find_arbitrage.py <PRICE_ALERT_PERCENTAGE>   ---------------------> Searches several US exchanges for any coins with a <PRICE_ALERT_PERCENTAGE> price differential from coinmarketcap value

only files needed are find_arbirage.py and get_exchange_prices.py

Spot out whale market orders as soon as they happen

# Crypto_Arbitrage

pip install tradingview-ta

python tradingviewprices.py <PRICE_ALERT_PERCENTAGE>

set PRICE_ALERT_PERCENTAGE to desired differential 

compares cryptocurrency prices for individual coins across several exchanges and looks for coins with large differences in price indicating an arbitrage opportunity.

$python tradingviewprices.py 6  ----------> searches exchanges in exchange_list.txt for any coins with a 6% or greater price differential between any two exchanges.

This one isn't very good because it pulls data from tradingview which is limited.
